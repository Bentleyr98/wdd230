        <h1>Target Audiences</h1>
        <p>Our target audience range from the mom that just moved in, to the 
        families that visit for families reunions, to the avid hikers looking for 
        new summits to conquer. McCall is a beautiful small town tucked away in the 
        mountains of Idaho. This town attracts many different people who are looking
        for a break from the city and to breathe in the fresh mountain air.
        </p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>The first person I imagine that would benefit from this is a mom with her family that
            just moved into McCall. She's excited to explore the area and enjoy the 
            beautiful nature with her family and is looking for websites and information to
            start settling into the area. </p>
        <p>The next person I think of that would be interested in this site is the one
            that's in charge of their yearly family reunion. They want to know what kind of 
            community is there, the hikes they can do, places to stay at, campsites, restuarants,
            everything they want to do to make their family reunion comfortable and memorable.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p>We've got a mom that just moved into the neighborhood. It's summer, she wants
            to take the kids on a hike and help them learn how to appreciate this new place 
            they've moved to. So she hops online hoping to find a hike that the whole
            family can enjoy.</p>
        
        <p>Our next scenario is a Girls' Camp leader looking for a good camping spot. She wants 
            to know what the locals like instead of all the touristy spots.
        </p>
        <p>There's a business owner that's trying to get some traction going. They can then look up 
            the Chamber of Commerce for McCall, join and become more visible to the community and the locals.
        </p>

        <p>Another scenario is group of college students wanting to go hiking for the weekend. They can 
            hop on the website and get quick and easy access to all of the best hikes.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, McCall is very popular for their annual Winter Carnival. Thousands of people pour into this
            small town looking for food and housing while they enjoy the festivities. Here, the average Joe looking
            for a place to feed his family can hop on and see what are some of the best options that his family can 
            choose from.
